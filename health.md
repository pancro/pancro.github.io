# So, what happened?

## The event

On Saturday 16th January evening, totally out of the blue, I started seeing a blotch in the lower third of my left eye's field of vision.

I regularly have [visual migraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma) so, although this was a bit different, I didn't worry about it too much.

Thing is, the visual alterations due to visual migraine usually go away after a few minutes. This blotch was persistent, it lasted all Sunday and didn't go away on Monday morning (I still have it) so I decided to get in touch with Moorfields Eye Hospital, which is not far from where I live.

Due to covid, they're doing online consultations first, which is great. I explained what happened to the consultant and I was told to go to the eye hospital and get seen a soon as possible. Which was obviously not a good sign.

## Diagnosis

I was seen pretty quickly and diagnosed with [Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_retinal_artery_occlusion) (BRAO). In other words, a tiny blod clot had managed to travel all the way to a tiny artery in my retina and blocked blood flow. The affected retinal cells have shut down due to lack of blood supply and most likely died and it's irreversible.

This is not as bad as it sounds because my left eye was already messed up due to at least two occurrences of [keratitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis) I had when I was young. They left uncorrectible scars on my cornea and my vision from my left eye has been blurred for as long as I can remember. Again, it's not bad as it seems as my brain happily compensates for that, I have 3D vision, I can drive and have a pretty normal life.

## Not done yet

I have a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to see if my retina is repairing or if the damage is likely to be permanent. Doctors  will scan my retina a second time and compare it with the pictures they took on Monday.

Thing is, BRAO just very rarely happens by itself, at least not to people of my age group. A spontaneous, random event is possible but extremely unlikely. Like winning the lottery in reverse! A tiny blood clot of similar proportions anywhere else in the body would have been unlikely to cause any trouble.

So, quite rightly the doctor who saw me on Monday was not happy to just dismiss it as bad luck. They referred me to the [National Hospital's TIA clinic](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-service/neurology-and-neurosurgery/stroke-services-uclh) for further tests.

What is TIA, you may ask? Well, it's a [Trainstient Ischemic Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack), in other words, a mini-stroke.

## A (mini) stroke?

So, yeah. Looks like I didn't have a full stroke (otherwise I wouldn't be here writing about it) but it's possible I have a mini-stroke without even realising it. It might have been while I was asleep, or I'm simply too used to headaches and feeling like what other people would describe as shit due to insomnia and other causes that maybe I didn't notice it.

The significance of a TIA episode is that it can lead to a full-on stroke. This is even more significant because I have hypertension and a tendency to high cholesterol.

## What's happening now then?

I'm being treated as a patient who had a mini-stroke, regardless of whether this is what actually happened or not. So:

- in addition to the two drugs I take for high blood pressure, now I'm taking two anticoagulants, one cholesterol reducing medicine and a stomach protector because I'm flooding my stomach with new drugs
- although brain and blood vessels around my head and neck look normal, doctors want to investigate my heart for irregularieties which could lead to blood clots:
  - I have a [heart-monitoring device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holter_monitor) that I'm supposed to keep for a week, stuck to my chest
  - I will then have a blood pressure monitoring device that does pretty much the same thing for 24 hours (thank goodness, it's much more invasive, with a cuff that inflates every 20 minutes or so, I had it before)
  - On top of an ECG, blood tests and an MRI, I'll do an echocardiogram

## How are you?

The usual really. If it wasn't for this blotch, I wouldn't have noticed a thing.

I'm not particularly worried for my health. I'm a bit pissed off that I've lived the two healthiest years of my life, losing 15kg, exercising daily, eating healthily despite my food addiction.

If you know me well you'll understand that the things that bother me the most are:

- having to talk to so many people
- having my phone's ringer on in case they call me from the hospital
